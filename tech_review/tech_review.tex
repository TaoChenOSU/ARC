\section{Vision System Options - Cierra}
For autonomous operation, vision systems are critical. 
The three main options include stereoscopic cameras, Infrared (IR) based systems such as Microsoft's Kinect, and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) vision systems. 
With the exception of some forms of LiDar, all of these methods require what is called a disparity map, which creates a ?3D image? of the surface, that can be used for telling which objects in an image are closest or farthest away. 

\subsection{Stereo Vision}
Stereo-vision uses two different cameras to create disparity maps in order to create a sense of depth. 
This is similar to how our eyes work. 
The biggest benefit to a stereoscopic camera system is the ability to detect objects outdoors, as the cameras are able to function with vast amounts of ultraviolet (UV) light. 
IR LEDs can also be used in order to illuminate an area at night, also allowing for nighttime navigation. 
One of the challenges of stereo vision is the computational power required. 
Another is clarity of the disparity map without post processing of images, which makes real-time operation more difficult. \cite{acs}
OpenCV \cite{opencv} contains many examples of how to configure and process stereoscopic images, and is one of the largest vision resources. 


\subsection{IR Camera's such as Kinect and RealSense}
Using an infrared point map, these cameras are able to tell the disparity between the points, which helps in creating disparity maps. The most popular example of an IR camera system, is the Microsoft Kinect. 
A big advantage to IR camera?s, is the ability to function in low and non-natural lighting conditions, due to using the infrared spectrum, rather than only using the visible spectrum. 
The biggest problem with IR cameras, the functionality is greatly reduced outdoors, due to massive amount of infrared waves from the sun. 
IR cameras don?t meet our requirement of being able to use the vision system reliably outdoors.

\subsection{Lidar}
LiDAR works by using LAZERSSSS

\subsection{Our choice}
Due to the need to be able to navigate in outdoor environments, our team will start out attempting to use stereoscopic imaging as our primary vision system. We will do this using the OpenCV library to analyze the images, and create the disparity map that can be used for other purposes. If we have the computational power to post-process disparity maps in real time, we will attempt to do so.

\section{Image Analysis Software - Dan}
Image analysis, for the ARC project, is the processing of visual data received
from cameras into deterministic information, such as pathfinding, or spacial
awareness. This is the primary means for our autonomous vehicle to assess its
surroundings and find its way to a given waypoint while avoiding obstacles. We
require software that is freely available for use (via fairly liberal open
source licensing), known to be correct (works well) with little modification
needed, and has relatively easy to use API libraries.

\subsection{Option 1}

\subsection{Option 2}

\subsection{Option 3}

\subsection{Image analysis choice}
ArduPilot is our choice for image analysis software. The documentation for the
image analysis software researched was rather vague across the board when it
comes to information on path-finding and image analysis capabilities. So, while
we are going with ArduPilot to start with, we will not really know its effective
capability at obstacle avoidance and pathfinding until we have tested it.

\section{Telemetry Radio Communication - Dan}
In this section we will examine three different telemetry radios, comparing and
contrasting them and making a choice on which radio we will use for ARC.
Telemetry is simply the transmition of measurement data (velocity, angle,
rotation, etc.) by radio to some other place. [1] This data allows the user to know the current state of the vehicle. This is especially
important for autonomous operation, as the vehicle may not be operating within
line of sight. Telemetry transmission is
well-established, so we will not be comparing vastly different transmission
technologies, such as long range (MHz radio frequencies) versus short-range
(bluetooth) where the advantages of ranges of 2-15+ kilometers obviously
outweigh ranges of 20-100 meters.

The main criteria for consideration are:
\begin{itemize}

	\item Cost
		\subitem One of our main goals with ARC is to keep the costs low.
	\item Power consumption
		\subitem We have limited power available, therefore we need power
		consumption to be low.

	\item Ease of use
		\subitem The radio needs to be easily integrated into the autopilot
		system. This means it needs to have a developed API with little no
		modification required.

	\item Form factor
		\subitem The size and weight needs to be small and light. If it is too
		bulky, we might not have space on the vehicle. If it is too heavy, more
		power will be required to operate the drive system and will drain the
		battery faster.

\end{itemize}


\subsection{3DR 915 MHz Transceiver}

The 3DR 915 MHz telemetry radio has a cost of \$39.99 USD for two radios. It is
powered by the autopilot telemetry port (+5v) which means it has low power
consumption. This radio transceiver uses open source firmware, has a robust API,
and is fully compatible with PX4 Pro, DroneKit, and ArduPilot, using the MAVLink
protocol. These features will allow us to implement telemetry transmission with
little to no modification of the API, should we use one of those autopilot
systems.  The form factor has dimensions of 25.5 x 53 x 11 mm (including case,
but not antenna) at 11.5 grams (without antenna). [2]

The range of this transceiver is from 300 meters to several kilometers,
depending on the antenna arrangement.

Pros: inexpensive, small form factor, low power consumption.

Cons: range out of the box could be as low as 300 meters.


\subsection{RFD900 Radio Modem}

The RFD900 Radio Modem has a cost of \$259.99 USD for two radios. [3] It requires
seperate +5v power for operation which means that it has high power
consumption. This radio has open source firmware, a robust API, and is fully
compatible with PX4 Pro, DroneKit, and ArduPilot, using the MAVLink protocol,
which will allow us to implement telemetry transmission with little to no
modification of the API, should we use one of those autopilot systems. [4]

The form factor has dimensions of 70 x 40 x 23mm (including case, but not
antenna) at 14.5 grams (without
antenna).
The range of this transceiver is 25+ kilometers.

Pros: ultra long range.

Cons: expensive, large size.


\subsection{Openpilot OPLink Mini Ground and Air Station 433 MHz}

The OPLink Mini Ground Station has a cost of \$26.59 USD for two radios. [5] It
requires input voltage of +5v and can be powered off the autopilot telemetry
port which means that it has low power consumption. This radio has open source
firmware but is only compatible with the OpenPilot RC control system. 
The form factor has dimensions of 38 x 23 x mm (including case, but not
antenna) at 4 grams (without antenna). [6]
The range of this radio is not known, but based on the power requirements and
frequency it likely has less range than the 3DR 915 MHz radio.

Pros: smallest size and weight (only 4 grams), lowest cost (\$26.59 USD)

Cons: Only works with the LibrePilot control system.


\subsection{Telemetry radio choice}
The 3DR 915 MHz Transceiver is our selection for the telemetry radio.
While the OPLink Mini Ground Station was significantly smaller, lighter, and
cheaper than the other two, its implementation being tied solely to LibrePilot
was a deal breaker (more information on LibrePilot can be found in the User
Interface evaluation).
The RF900 Radio Modem would have been a good choice, it has fantastic range
and all the API options we were looking for. But it had a significantly larger
form factor, required a separate power supply, and was quite expensive at
\$259.99. Put together, these facts eliminated the RF900 as a viable option.
The 3DR 915 MHz Transceiver is a good balance of cost, performance, and size. The
cost of \$39.99 for two radios, the ability to power the autopilot off the
telemetry port, and the portability of its APIs and their ease of use, puts the
3DR 915 MHz at the top of our list and the clear choice for the telemetry
radio going forward.

\section{User Interface - Dan}
In this section we will examine three user interfaces, comparing and contrasting
them and making a decision on which one we will use with ARC.
A user interface (UI) is required to allow the user to command the vehicle. The
UI must be open source and have easy-to-implement API libraries. We are looking
for a UI package that will work with both the control station (the user
computer) and the companion computer (the computer on board the vehicle). It is
preferrable that the UI be a combination of graphical UI (GUI) and command line
UI (CLI). Note that though our project is a land vehicle (rover) the following
software is primarily used for UAV flight control and is referenced in such a
way. If possible, we would like to use software that can be configured to
control a rover, or easily modified to do so.

\subsection{QGroundControl}

QGroundControl (QGC) is a full flight control and mission planning GUI software
package that is compatible with any MAVLink enabled drone. [1] It is open source and
is configured for use with ArduPilot and PX4 Pro. QGC runs on Windows, OS X,
Linux, and iOS and Android tablets. QGC has video streaming with instrument
overlays, allows mission planning including map point selection, rally points,
and even a virtual fence to keep the drone from going beyond a specified area.
QGC is a mature software package that has excellent libraries and support with
very good documentation. [2]
Additionally, QGC works with ArduPilot which is known to work with the PXFMini ,
the autopilot we intend to use and can be configured for rovers. [3] QGC appears
be GUI only with no CLI functionality.

Pros: easy to use, great documentation, compatible with MAVLink, tested on the
PXFMini. Can be used on all major pc and mobile platforms. Supports rovers.

Cons: does not appear to have CLI support.

\subsection{Tower/DroneKit-Android}(http://android.dronekit.io/) (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.droidplanner.android\&hl=en)
Tower is a Android mobile app that works with most drones that use the MAVLink
protocol. Tower allows basic map point selection and allows drawing a flight
path on the tablet. [4] It is based on the open source DroneKit-Android framework.
DroneKit-Android has good documentation providing code snippets with working
example code. [5] Because of the modularity of Android development and access to
Tower source code, adding feature and interfaces to the existing app should be
relatively easy. Tower is not configured for rovers, so we would have to write
the functionality into it. DroneKit-Android and Tower are only available on Android. 

Pros: is easy to use, has basic map point selection, adding features should be
relatively straight-forward.

Cons: is only available on Android, configuring for rovers requires writing code
for support.

\subsection{LibrePilot}
(https://www.librepilot.org/site/index.html)  

LibrePilot (LP) is a full flight control and mission planning software
package. It is open source and operates via GUI and allows map point selection.
LP is compatible with OpenPilot control system exclusively. It does not
work with any other hardware but OpenPilot hardware and does not have rover
support. It has some helpful documentation, such as Windows build instructions,
but the information is very basic. The source code does seem to have decent
commenting which could help since we would need to heavily modify the code base
for rover support. LP runs on Linux, Mac, Windows, and Android. [6]

Pros: Has a nice GUI for map point selection, mission planning, and vehicle
control. If used in the OpenPilot ecosystem, it should communicate well. Runs
on most major pc platforms.

Cons: Is locked in to the OpenPilot ecosystem. Does not have rover support out
of the box which will require extensive coding. Does not run in iOS.

\subsection{User interface choice}
QGroundControl is our user interface choice.\par
LibrePilot has similar features to QGC but being locked in to the OpenPilot
ecosystem is a deal breaker. We need to be able to use the PXFMini and
LibrePilot cannot do that. LP is also not configured for rovers, which would
require extensive coding.\par
Tower is the most modest of the user interface options. It is only available on
Android, does not have rover support and has limited options for navigation and
vehicle control. For these reasons we reject Tower as a viable option.\par
QGroundControl runs on all major pc and mobile platforms, is configured to run
rovers, and uses the MAVLink protocol. It has a nice GUI and allows map point
selection and advanced mission planning. It is known to work with the PXFMini
flight controller, a component we want to use as part of the ARC build. These
features give us a platform that is meets our needs and is flexible, should our
needs change. Therefore, QGroundControl is the clear user interface choice for
the ARC project.
