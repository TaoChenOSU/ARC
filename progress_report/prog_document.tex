\section{Project purpose and goals} 
% Breifly recaps project purpose and goals
The purpose of the Autonomous RC (ARC) project is to determine if it is possible
to build an autonomous RC vehicle using commodity components, meaning components
that are relatively inexpensive and can be bought at places like Radio
Shack\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, Best Buy\textsuperscript{\textregistered}, or on Amazon. \\
Our goal is to make an RC vehicle navigate autonomous to a given
waypoint/location, preferably at a high rate of speed. Stretch goals are to
make the vehicle drift around corners and parallel park.\\

%\[Be sure to add graphic back in before final render!!\]
\begin{figure}[H]
   	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{autorally_platform_header}
    \caption{Drifting example. Image from https://autorally.github.io/}
\end{figure}

While our main goal is to have a functioning autonomous RC vehicle we also hope
that we can produce instructions that RC enthusiasts can follow to produce a
functioning, consumer-grade autonomous RC vehicle of their own.

\section{Current Status}
% Describes where we currently are on the project.
Currently, we have finished our project proposal, SRS, tech review, and the preliminary version of our design document. 
Our design document is a week behind where we would like to be, as it was difficult to complete the SRS document without having first done the tech review. 
This significantly impeded our progress, as we were scrambling to finish the SRS after we had finished the tech review, and then our design document was due a few days later.
There was definitely a large wall we had to climb without hand holds in terms of knowledge that this project required.\par

The first step in implementation will be testing if the hardware we have, works with the software we would like to use. 
The design document talked about how the system communicated, and what milestones we wanted to be able to meet at a basic level. 
Once these preliminary milestones are met, we can advance the design document to reflect the requirements we are trying to meet. \par

Now that we have a better idea of how the system fits together, we plan over break to work on the first steps of the milestones proposed in the design document. 
This will be the first point where we see if what we have can function in the way we are hoping, or if we need to modify which hardware we are using to accomplish the goal.
One big piece of this will be seeing if we can process vision data fast enough for our needs, to ensure that our goal is even possible. 
We have no plans of testing with the car until we are sure that all of our hardware is talking properly. 
Ideally by the end of break we will be ready to either modify our design, or start retrofitting the hardware onto the vehicle.

\section{Week-by-week summary of activities}

One thing to note about the following weekly activity summary: if some of our
descriptions seem a bit vague, that is because our understanding of this project
is still fairly vague. We are discovering what we need for this project to
succeed as we go. As the project progresses our focus will narrow and details
will become more concrete. Right now, our understanding of the project is still very
abstract, therefore the concepts and details that we describe are also vague and
somewhat abstract.

\subsection{Weeks 1 - 2}
Weeks one and two were general introduction and orientation weeks. It was
not until week 3 that projects started in earnest and the first assignment was
assigned.

\subsection{Week 3}
	\begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Activities}:\\
            Worked on creating the problem statement. This required getting an
            overall understanding of what our autonomous RC vehicle should be able
            to do. In other words, getting on paper the expectations of our client
            for the final product. We also started researching what we would need
            for the SRS document, both in terms of the ARC project and in terms of
            the \LaTeX~document. We needed a Gantt chart for the SRS, so we started
            researching how to do that.

        \item \textit{Problems}:\\
            Our client was ill during this time, so feedback for the problem
            statement was understandably delayed. We struggled a little with using
            the proper tense in the document and getting a high-enough, yet detailed
            enough written view of the ARC project. We needed clarification on
            details for the expected vehicle capabilities.

        \item \textit{Solutions}:\\
            We talked with our client on how to frame our project appropriately.
            For the vehicle capabilities, our client told us to aim high, if we
            need to scale things back later we will.

	\end{itemize}
 
\subsection{Week 4}
	\begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Activities}:\\
            Received feedback on our problem statement and made required
            changes. We needed to clarify what our motivation for the project
            was, namely that we are trying to create an autonomous RC system
            that is considerably less expensive than current research platforms
            (think \$1-2k vs \$10-15k). Created a template for the SRS document
            and started looking into what requirements our project needed.

        \item \textit{Problems}:\\
            The three of us on the ARC team have no prior experience with ECE,
            in general and Autonomy or RC vehicles, in particular. This lack of
            experience makes writing these beginning documents somewhat abstract
            because we do not know what is involved.

        \item \textit{Solutions}:\\
            We spent time with our client to talk through some of the
            requirements. Clarifying why this project matters also helped us
            narrow the scope of our requirements a little bit. We could focus on
            low-cost, readily available components. While that still leaves
            quite a bit to discover, it also eliminates expensive, yet otherwise
            viable, options.

	\end{itemize}
   
\subsection{Week 5}
	\begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Activities}:\\
            Worked on the SRS document. This phase of the project required us to
            brainstorm what components our system needed and how they fit
            together.\\
            For instance, system interfaces has many parts so we had to sit down
            and talk through what connects and talks to what and visualize how
            that looks. For the SRS, filled out the introduction, software
            interfaces, communications interfaces, and the overall layout of the
            general control flow.\\
            Researched how to construct a Gantt chart in \LaTeX. We also decided
            on what parts we each would take responsibility for and write about
            in the tech review document.

        \item \textit{Problems}:\\
            The SRS document needed different indexing (numeric, as opposed to
            Roman numeral). This required some effort to figure out how to
            reformat the document to use a different indexing scheme without
            changing the controlling document class.\\  
            Other problems: 
            The nature of our project is complex. Therefore,
            there are many parts to the requirements for this project. We needed
            to estimate what the project would need, but again, without
            experience.\\
            Researching and building a working Gantt chart in \LaTeX~took about
            9 hours. The system is very cumbersome, which makes one not want to
            revisit it to make changes.

        \item \textit{Solutions}:\\
            Fixed the \LaTeX~index formatting issue by adding an argument to the
            IEEEtran.cls options. This turned out to be a pretty easy fix, but
            took quite a while to figure out.\\
            We tackled the complexity of this project by meeting together and
            drawing out a rough sketch of major components and how they relate
            to each other.\\

	 %\[Be sure to add graphic back in before final render!!\]            
            \begin{figure}[H]
              	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{system_whiteboard_drawing}
               \caption{White board drawing at first SRS meeting.}
           \end{figure}

            This gave us a starting point to work from and fill out details for
            what will be required in this project. A big caveat is that these
            are still an \textit{estimate} of requirements. We won't really know
            where we are correct or where we need to add until we get hands-on
            with the hardware and software.\\
            Somewhat mitigated the arduous nature of the \LaTeX~Gantt chart by
            creating a sort of auto-calculation of the percentages for the
            different tasks and sub-tasks.

	\end{itemize}
   
\subsection{Week 6}
	\begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Activities}:\\
            This was a \textit{very} research-heavy week. We did in-depth
            research on our main areas of emphasis: system interfaces, user
            interfaces, hardware interfaces, communications interfaces, sensors,
            navigation, hardware mounting (how to physically attach the
            components to the vehicle), system control and data processing, and
            path planning. We created a block diagram of the structure and data
            flow of the project.\\

		%	\[Be sure to add graphic back in before final render!!\]
           \begin{figure}[H]
              	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Block_Diagram}
                \caption{Structure and data flow of the ARC project}
            \end{figure}

            We worked simultaneously on the tech review and SRS documents. This
            is likely going to be a better strategy moving forward, research
            some area of the project, determine a requirement based off of the
            research, try to implement, record our findings and adjust the
            requirements further if necessary.

        \item \textit{Problems}:\\
            Which came first, the chicken or the egg? This is how it feels to be
            writing the documents for this research project. In order to know what
            requirements are reasonable/feasible, we need to know what tech is out
            there and if/how it fits with related components.

        \item \textit{Solutions}:\\
            To get around some of the issues we are having we decided to write
            the SRS and the tech review somewhat concurrently. This allowed us
            to research our areas of the tech review and then have a better
            understanding of what a reasonable requirement might be for the
            project.

	\end{itemize}
   
\subsection{Week 7}
	\begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Activities}:\\
        This week was very similar to week 6, as we continued to research more about our topics and headway on the SRS.\\ 
        We managed to finish the introduction of the document and we described the general interfaces between components, even though we were unsure of what components were going to be used. 
        Here is a list of some of the components that were researched and their results:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Image analysis software\\
    	    Found DroneKit-Python, ArduPilot, and LibrePilot.
    	    \item Telemetry radios \\
    	    Found 3DR 915 MHz Transceiver, RFD900 Radio Modem, and OpenPilot OPLink Mini Ground and Air Station 433 MHz
    	    \item User interfaces\\
    	    Found QGroundControl, DroneKit-Android, and LibrePilot
    	    \item Vision System \\
    	    Found stereo vision camera implementations, different methods for parsing stereo vision, and the benefits and challenges of LiDAR
    	    \item System Interfaces \\
    	    Found hardware specifications for Intel NUC, UPBoard, and Raspberry Pi 3, along with documentation on the PXFmini
    	    \item Sensors\\
    	    Found data specifications for GPS, IMU options, and PXFmini's onboard sensors
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textit{Problems}:\\
        The biggest problem we had this week were sifting through hardware documentation, that was well... lacking in the documentation aspect. 
        The SRS document was also conceptually difficult without having an understanding of the technology behind it, which made it feel as if in order to finish the SRS, namely the requirements section, we would need to do the tech-review first to have a better understanding of what the realistic capabilities of the technology 
        Another problem was trying to make progress on the SRS document without having completed the tech review first.
        
        \item \textit{Solutions}:\\
        We spent more of our time researching to gain a better understanding of what we would need to do. 
        When we found technology that seemed promising, we would add it as a component to our tech review.
        Stepping back to look at the broader picture also helped us be able to fill out a good portion of the first half of the document.
	\end{itemize}
   
\subsection{Week 8}
	\begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Activities}:\\
        This week was focused on more research, primarily for the tech review. 
        Thursday was also thanksgiving break, so not a lot happened between Wednesday and Sunday. 
        \item \textit{Problems}:\\
        The biggest problem was sifting through a lot of research that doesn't have any examples to look at. 
        \item \textit{Solutions}:\\
        Found as many basic examples as possible.
	\end{itemize}
   
\subsection{Week 9}
	\begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Activities}:\\
        This week we managed to finish our tech review and started making progress on filling out our SRS document.
        We would call this the "AHA!" week in terms of progress, as we finally
        started to see how our project was going to come together.\\
        After turning in the tech review, we were able to start filling out requirements, which was significantly easier after knowing what the realistic capabilities of our hardware. 
        
        \item \textit{Problems}:\\
        The biggest problem was being a week behind where we would have liked to be. 
        Our SRS document was still not completed, even though we were making a lot of progress. 
       
        \item \textit{Solutions}:\\
        Our solution was to keep on moving forward and trying not to be affected
        too much by the setback from the previous documents.\\ 
        The next step was finishing our SRS document so that progress could be made on the design document. 
	\end{itemize}
   
\subsection{Week 10}
	\begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Activities}:\\
        We finished our SRS document, and received Kevin's seal of approval. 
        The feedback we received was positive, which was surprising and satisfying at the same time. 
        We finished the design document. This is a preliminary design for what
        the layout and communication methods will be, along with generally what
        software we will be using, and what milestones we will need to hit in
        order to test the viability of our solution.
        While doing the design document, we also successfully ran the AutoRally project on ROS. So that was a big step. We finally 
        had something that was relatively more tangible. 
        
        \item \textit{Problems}:\\
        The biggest problem comes back to being a week behind and needing to finish the design document. 
        As a research project, the design document specifications from the IEEE format didn't follow what we needed, so we ended up having to talk more about our process and general design, rather than specifics, since they are still unknown. 
        
        \item \textit{Solutions}:\\
       	We managed to finish the design document by just putting in as much time as needed, however, it wasn't quite to the level that we would have liked. 
	This means we will continue to develop the document to better meet the specifications, once we have tested our system viability. 
	If the system is not viable, we will revisit the design and see what needs to be done in order to succeed. 
	\end{itemize}
