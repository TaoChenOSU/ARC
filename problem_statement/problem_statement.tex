\begin{abstract}
Currently, autonomous vehicles are built with many custom parts and assemblies
and are very expensive. The cost of entry to autonomous vehicles is often
prohibitive for the average consumer. The purpose of this project is to determine
if it is possible to build an autonomous RC vehicle using commodity hardware.
This will be accomplished using commodity hardware, including cameras, computers,
and the RC vehicle used as the base, with minimal fabrication.\par

\section{Problem Definition}
Autonomous vehicles often cost thousands of dollars to build, and there are few
options available that can be easily retrofitted. Our goal is to find out whether
or not it is possible to take commodity hardware, retrofit it onto an RC car, and
have it be able to navigate obstacles at speed. We also want to create a list of
hardware components and a software solution that can be retrofitted onto at least
one model of RC car, in order to enable autonomous navigation and operation.\par
This implementation would be a small scale version of the DARPA Grand Challenge,
where autonomous vehicles navigate themselves 100 miles through the Mojave Desert,
in under 10 hours. Our goal is to implement an RC car able to navigate to a given
point as fast as possible, which is a small-scale version of the challenge. The RC
car should be able to navigate through a room or space, without prior knowledge of
the environment, within a set amount of time and parallel park. Stretch goals for
the project would be high-speed obstacle avoidance and drifting on a dirt track.\par
As this is a research project, we do not know if it is possible to implement 
these features. Millions, if not billions of dollars have been allocated for
research of autonomous vehicles. A lot of the hardware is very specialized, and
often very expensive. Our challenge is to see if it is possible to replicate a small
subset of the expensive system's abilities, at a small-scale, using hardware that costs 
hundreds of dollars instead of thousands or hundreds of thousands. 

\section{Proposed Solution}
Our solution will prove if it is possible to implement autonomous point-to-point
navigation of an RC vehicle in low-speed and high-speed scenarios using
off-the-shelf retail/commodity hardware (i.e. something you could purchase from
Best Buy, Radio Shack, Amazon, etc.).  The software will be an implementation of
readily available open-source distributions, such as Georgia Tech's GT
AutoRally. For hardware, we will use a retail RC vehicle as the base with
additional hardware for computation, such as the Intel NUC micro-PC, and
control, such as the BeagleBone micro-PC with a PixHawk Fire Cape. The major 
components including cameras, GPS, accelerometers, etc. will be kept as close 
to retail as possible. Certain hardware, such as mounts, may need to be fabricated 
to attach components, like the mini-PC, to the RC vehicle.\par
This project will be successful if the RC vehicle is able to autonomously
navigate point-to-point using low-speed obstacle avoidance and high-speed
maneuvering when appropriate. Examples of low-speed scenarios are ninety-degree
corners, tight s-turns, or multiple offset obstacles in the path. High-speed
scenarios will include straight-line acceleration and drifting through
large-radius corners.\par
While a successful result is the desired outcome, an unsuccessful result, if 
accompanied by enough data and documentation, will prove that it is not yet 
possible to implement autonomy at the RC model scale using only off-the-shelf, 
retail/commodity hardware (as described above).\par
Our presentation at Engineering Expo will be a booth that will either show successful
autonomy of an RC vehicle or show why it is not yet possible to produce the
autonomous requirements specified in the problem definition. The presentation
will include a large poster with the team/project name and smaller displays
depicting elements of the project process. There will be a video comprised of the
final capstone presentation and also footage of the project taken throughout
the term and will have basic editing and formatting for appearance. We will have
our final capstone report available for those interested and will display the RC
vehicle used in the project. The project team members will accompany the Engineering Expo
presentation and will interact with those interested.

\section{Performance Metrics}
Basic Criteria:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Self-navigate from point to point.
	\item Low-speed obstacle avoidance
	\item Parallel parking
\end{itemize}
 Advanced Criteria and Stretch Goals:
 \begin{itemize}
	\item Obstacle avoidance at high speed.
	\item Drifting (Dust track) 
	\item Track current position with respect to the location of the base station in
		order to not have the car drive away.
\end{itemize}
At the end of Spring 2017 (before the Engineering Expo), all the basic
objectives above should be accomplished on the RC vehicle provided, with minimal
specialized hardware and fabrication. Advanced Criteria and Stretch goals will
be used to provide additional criteria if the basic criteria are finished early.
If a final product is not delivered on time (before the Engineering Expo), we
shall provide strong reasonings on why an objective was not feasible with the
time and given resources.

The outcome of this project will be measured on the completeness of the final
product or the soundness of the reasonings if any of the objectives are not
achieved.
