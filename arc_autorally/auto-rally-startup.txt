=== Autorally Start Up Instructions ===

NOTE: It is assumed that you have already gone through the "Autonomous Driving in Simulation" instructions at https://github.com/AutoRally/autorally

These instructions are intended for AFTER initial setup and first run through.

1. Whenever a new terminal window is opened, run the three following commands:
$ source /opt/ros/<ros-version>/setup.bash
$ source <path-to-catkin-workspace>/devel/setup.bash
$ source <path-to-catkin-workspace>/src/autorally/autorally_utils/setupEnvLocal.sh

(Optionally, the preceeding three lines can be placed in ~/.bashrc so that they don't have to be source each time the terminal window is opened

2. Start up the autorally simulator in Gazebo:
$ roslaunch autorally_gazebo autoRallyTrackGazeboSim.launch

3. Open new terminal and Start rqt_publisher:
$ rosrun rqt_publisher rqt_publisher

4. Open new terminal and start the state estimator:
** First set the initial pose of the car:
$ rosparam set /gps_imu/FixedInitialPose true
** Then start the state estimator:
$ roslaunch autorally_core stateEstimator.launch

5. Open a new terminal and start the way point follower:
$ roslaunch autorally_control waypointFollower.launch

6. Open a new terminal and start the constant speed controller:
$ roslaunch autorally_control constantSpeedController.launch

7. Go back to rqt_publisher and make sure the topics created during initial setup are still there:
/runStop
/chassisState
/constantSpeedController/speedCommand

If rqt_publisher does have those three topic in the main part of the window, go back to the setup instructions and add them.

8. Check the boxes to the left of those three topics.

You should now see the vehicle start to move.
