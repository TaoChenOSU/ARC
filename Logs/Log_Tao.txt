This document records everything I have done by days.

  I have been working with the AutoRally project for a long time now. I added a lidar sensor
  on the roof of the simulated car. Yesterday I was able to get data out of the sensor with
  a Ros node that I wrote. However, I wasn't able to visualize the data on Rviz. But then
  today I found out that I could change the name of the frame in my node. The name of the frame
  contained in the messages published by the lidar unit was "autorally_platform/lidar". Rviz was
  looking "/lidar".
  The node I wrote subscribes to the "/autorally_platform/lidar" topic, changes the name of the
  frame to "/lidar" and publishes the messages. So now I am able to visualize the lidar data on
  Ros.
  Next step, dive into obstacle avoidance. The idea I have right now is
      1. alter the waypointfollower node such that it publishes the current stack of waypoints.
      2. make to node that subscribes to waypoints and lidar data.
      3. use RRT algorithm (Rapidly-exploring random tree) to analyze obstacle and generate new trajectories.
      4. publish new trajectory to the waypointfollower.
