# Project Changes Documentation
* Any changes we made to the project since our original documentation should be put in a table located in a tex file.
* The name of the tex file corresponds with the area of focus.
    * e.g. Changes to the design of the project should be documented in <code>design_changes.tex</code>.

# Compile Final Report
* The final report is intended to be compiled on [ShareLatex.com](http://www.sharelatex.com)
* To compile, be sure to upload all documents (except <code>changes_template.tex</code>) in this directory (final/) to ShareLatex.
