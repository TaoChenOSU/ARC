\section{Introduction} % Section 1; Cierra, Done
This document aims to provide an overview and list of requirements for group 44, Autonomous RC (ARC). 
This section provides a purpose and scope description, list of abbreviations and acronyms, and an overview of everything included in this SRS document. 
As this is a research project, some of the sections within the document may not apply to the project. 


\subsection{Purpose} % Cierra, Done
A detailed description of the requirements for the "Autonomous RC System" or ARCS will be provided within this document. 
System constraints, interface decisions, and interactions with other external applications and hardware will also be explained. 
This document is primarily intended to be a customer proposal for approval and a development team reference for the first version of the system.

\subsection{Scope} % Cierra, Done
ARCS is a software-hardware interface designed to retrofit RC cars for autonomous operation, using commodity hardware. 
The software and hardware specifications should be available free to download and modify at the users will. \par
Users should be able to purchase and install the specified hardware from major online retailes such as Amazon.com or hobby sites such as Sparkfun.com.
Once the vehicle is assembled, it should be able to autonomously navigate to a given destination using GPS, or a within pre-defined boundaries, such as a room.  
Control software will need to be loaded onto the main processing unit and any other control hardware needed. 
Other software required will be a control panel to monitor the vehicle and determine it's behavior, such as navigating to a point, or on a track. 

Hardware that we expect to need:
\begin{itemize} 
\item Base station that includes a transceiver
\item An RC car with servo steering and DC motors
\item Main processing unit (a computer)
\item Transceiver to send and receive information on the car
\item Controller to send signals to sensors and actuation devices (motors, servos, etc...) 
\item Vision system to aide in obstacle avoidance
\item GPS unit to aide in navigation
\end{itemize}

ARCS will be expected to be able to receive input from a user base station, and react
within the environment based on a destination or path that the system receives. It should also
be able to navigate to the destination without user intervention, as fast as possible. \par

\section{Overall Description} % Section 2; Cierra, Done
This section will explain the system in its context to create a better understanding of how the system interacts with other systems.
In addition, basic functionality will be introduced and addressed. 
Stakeholders will be defined and functionality for each type of stakeholder will be adressed. 
Lastly, constraints and assumptions for the system will be presented. 

% This section usually consists of six subsections, as follows:
% \begin{enumerate}
%	\item Product perspective;
%	\item Product functions;
%	\item User characteristics;
%	\item Constraints;
%	\item Assumptions and dependencies;
%	\item Apportioning of requirements.
% \end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Product Perspective} % Cierra, kinda done for now
ARCS will be designed to integrate into an RC car using commodity hardware, and open to anyone who is interested in using it. This 
makes ARCS a component of a larger system, namely the RC car. \par
ARCS will consist of three parts: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Base-station used for user interaction
	\item Hardware attached to RC car to be able to connect to base-station and 
		operate the vehicle
	\item Software implementation for control and communication between hardware and software
\end{enumerate}
In order for the user to interact with the vehicle, commands will be sent via some form
of receiver to the car. This will need to be done via a base-station that has software able of
providing a way to communicate with the receiver, which then transmits data to the receiver on 
the car, which is then handled by the on-board computer. 
The control flow is described in figure 1. \\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% This subsection of the SRS should put the product into perspective with other
% related products. If the product is independent and totally self-contained, it
% should be so stated here. If the SRS defines a product that is a component of a
% larger system, as frequently occurs, then this subsection should relate the
% requirements of that larger system to functionality of the software and should
% identify interfaces between that system and the software.

%A block diagram showing the major components of the larger system,
%interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful.
%
%This subsection should also describe how the software operates inside various
%constraints. For example, these constraints could include
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item System interfaces;
%	\item User interfaces;
%	\item Hardware interfaces;
%	\item Software interfaces;
%	\item Communications interfaces;
%	\item Memory;
%	\item Operations;
%	\item Site adaptation requirements.
%\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{System interfaces} %Tao, finished
There are a total of 5 system interfaces where the system can communicate with 
the outside world.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Sensors: Sensors will have a two-way communication with a secondary computer unit, where filtering and smoothing will happen before reliable data will be passed to the main processing unit. 
	The programs that reside in the secondary unit will utilize various methods to generate reliable results based on the raw data. 
	At start-up, there will be a script executed by the system to correctly configure and calibrate each sensor. 
	Sensors may include: battery monitor, temperature sensor, GPS, encoders, IMUs, and any other sensors that are needed for autonomous operation.
	\item Radio: This is the portal of the system where operator/user can monitor the status of the vehicle. 
	Different protocols will be implemented for telemetry data, which will be displayed to the operator/user. 
	This portal also allows operator/user to take control over the computer in case of emergencies. 
	\item Visual unit: This is the interface where the visual unit can pass streams of images to the system.
	\item Actuator: The system issues commands to the motors and servos via this interface. 
	\item User interface: This interface is a different interface than the radio interface even though they both allow humans to interact with the system. 
	The user interface will be disable after the vehicle starts maneuvering. 
	This interface allows user to input operation modes and desired destinations into the system.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{User interfaces} %Tao, finished
The user interface will be a graphical user interface (GUI) that can be interacted with by a user. 
Anyone who knows how to operate a mouse or touch screen will be al. 
A map makes it easier for users to pin point destinations and view the current location of the vehicle. 
An error messages will be generated the vehicle and the station exceeds the maximum radio range, or the vehicle is low on battery.\par
With proper training (in less than 30 minutes), one can understand all the indicators of the system to know the status of the vehicle.\par
The GUI is a single window/page arrangement. 
A large portion of the window is dedicated to the map. 
A section of the GUI will be used to display telemetry data. 
Error messages will cover at least 10\% of the screen in order to alert the user of an issue.

\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces} % Cierra
Two main hardware interfaces currently exist within ARCS. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Vision processing
	\item Telemetry collection and actuator control
\end{enumerate}

Vision processing, from either a stereoscopic or depth camera, will be interfaced through 
an i5 or better processor from an on board computer using a control board, which will be used as an interface between a 
computer that is doing high level computations, the servos, motors, and other telemetry 
devices. 

Telemetry collection and actuator control will be handled by a PXFmini and interfaced through a board with a 40pin connector, such as the Raspberry Pi. This abstracts a lot of control onto the PXFmini. 

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces} % Dan
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item We require three operating systems. One for a remote PC for user input, one
	for the primary computer for on-car data analysis, and one for the secondary
	computer for on-car control.
	
	\item We require a user interface to be able to give the car destination commands. 
	
	\item We require software that takes input from hardware, such as video cameras,
	and analyze the data 
	
	\item Sensor analysis software needs to be able to read data from sensors, such IMUs, and generate usable information to pass on to 
	
	\item Path finding software needs to be able to integrate and analyze data from mapping and localization software products and determine a path to follow in real time.
	
	\item The primary and secondary computers will need to talk with one another. The
	primary computer will need to receive data from the secondary computer,
	analyze the data and send corresponding commands back to the secondary
	computer. The secondary computer will need to receive commands from the
	primary computer, and send data to the primary computer.
	
	\item A software interface will required on the secondary computer to convert
	commands received from the primary computer to instructions usable by
	pre-existing RC car on-board controller.
	
	\item We will require separate interfaces between the secondary computer and the
	visual/spacial sensors, GPS, speed sensor, and the IMU. 
	
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Communications Interfaces} % Dan
%This should specify the various interfaces to communications such as local
%network protocols, etc.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Radio communication will required to be able to send commands to the car and
	to be able to receive feedback from the car. The radio frequency will be in 27
	MHz or 49 MHz range. We need software that allows us to send and receive radio
	signals to and from the car. 
	
	\item LAN communication will be used to transmit data between the on-car computers.
	Existing network protocols will be utilized to perform the transmissions.
	
	\item A software interface will be required to send the commands from the
	secondary computer to the pre-existing RC car on-board controller.
	
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Memory constraints} %Tao, done
%This should specify any applicable characteristics and limits on primary and
%secondary memory.
Since we are unsure of what hardware will be used, we are not able to set any 
constraints on the memory requirements that the system has to meet. 

\subsubsection{Operations} %Tao
In most cases, operations of the system will be isolated from the user/operator,
excluding emergencies and initialization.  
%This should specify the normal and special operations required by the user such as
\begin{enumerate}
	\item At initailization, user/operator has to thoroughly check the body of the
	vehicle, making usre that all components are firmly attached as well as the 
	bettary level is at least 80\%;
	\item Destination will be given by the user at the station during initialization;
	\item User is allowed to take over control from the system in case of emergencies
	via the remote control;
	\item User/operator is resposible for monitoring the status of the system, such as 
	battery level, speed, location, distance, radio signal strength, pre-planned path, 
	etc.
\end{enumerate}
%This could the extension of the user interface section.
%This is sometimes specified as part of the User Interfaces section.

\subsubsection{Site Adaptation Requirements}
For research and prototype purposes, no site adaptation requirements are relevant. 

\subsection{Product Functions} %Tao, finished
This system utilizes resources from more than one computer and controls multiple actuators. 
The system is designed to minimize user interference during operations, however, monitoring is required.
Maintainability of the system is not considered to be user-oriented, which means a user/operator should not be worried about maintaining the system. 
The system will be made available publicly (open source), however, only users with extensive robotics experience should attempt at modifying the system outside of the given parameters.


\subsection{User Characteristics} % Cierra
Our system should be able to be built and operated by a user with at least two 
years of university engineering coursework and one two years, a user with over 
five years of technical experience through work in either an electrical or software 
industry, and a RC hobbyist with over five years of experience. 

\subsection{Constraints} % Tao, finished
As this is a research project, constraints may rapidly change or new constraints may be retroactively added to better address problems found or the needs of the system. \par
Current constraints for the project include: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Real time image processing will limit the vehicle's ability to maneuver through obstacles. 
	\item Telemetry data displayed to the user will be slightly delayed due to long distance. 
	No solutions to this issue are currently available.
	\item The vehicle's natural structure will inevitably cause more uncertainty on predictions, which requires the use of more complicated algorithms versus what is required for ideal conditions.
	\item Hardware may fall off during operation which will force the system to halt. 
	All components must be securely fastened and adequately protected in the case of an emergency.  
	\item Telemetry data transfer are limited to radio during outdoor operations.
	\item The success rate are set to 80\% and above.
	\item For research purpose only, the vehicle will only be required to navigate around static objects in an environment. 
	This is to reduce the complexity of the initial system. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
As a research project, the main assumption is currently this is possible. 

\subsection{Apportionment of Requirements} % Dan, in progress
See next page.
%This subsection of the SRS should identify requirements that may be delayed
%until future versions of the system.

\include{gantt_chart}

\section{Specific Requirements} % Section 3
This section describes the hardware, software, and performance requirements
necessary for the ARC system to function. It lays out requirements for
input and output of the system through interfaces. It also covers the major
systems features and functional requirements for those features.

\subsection{External interface requirements}
This section describes all of the interfaces required for input to and output
from the ARC system.
	\subsubsection{User interfaces}
	There should be a remote station (commonly referred to as a ground station) where all information about the vehicle can be seen.
	The ground station should allow user control of the vehicle including setting way-points, adjusting parameters for vehicle behavior, and direct control over vehicle movement.
	
	\subsubsection{Hardware interfaces}
	There should be hardware interfaces for manual control of the vehicle. This	interface should be able to override software control so that users can	safely commandeer control of the vehicle from the autopilot. 
	Other hardware interfaces should be between a network interface between the autopilot and the companion computer on the vehicle.
	There should also be a hardware interface between the autopilot and the vehicle control system.
	We will use existing protocols for communication between the autopilot and the companion computer and the vehicle.

	\subsubsection{Software interfaces}
	There should be software interfaces between the user interfaces and the hardware interfaces. These interfaces will be handled by the operating system on both the ground station and the companion computer.

	\subsubsection{Communications interfaces}

requirements describe what is required to achieve this.\par

	\paragraph{Functional requirement navigation 1}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item ID: FR-NAV1
			\item Title: Motor Control

			\item Dependencies: Motion Model
		\end{enumerate}

	\paragraph{Functional requirement navigation 4}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item ID: FR-NAV4
			\item Title: Motion Model
			\item Description: Motion model is significant as it decides what commands should be given by the computer under various circumstances.
			\item Rationale: This is like learning how to drive a car. Knowing the configuration of the car is critical for the computer to know how to control it. Different combinations of speed and turning angle will result in different paths. Under different surface and weight distributions, the vehicle will also act differently.

			\item Dependencies: FR-HW1
		\end{enumerate}



\subsubsection{System Feature: Communications}

	\paragraph{Functional Requirement Comms 1}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item ID: FR-CM1
			\item Title: Telemetry
			\item Description: Telemetry needs to be transmitted from the vehicle to a ground station.

\subsection{Design constraints}
%This should specify design constraints that can be imposed by other standards,
%hardware limitations, etc.
The ARC RC vehicle will be guaranteed to communication with the ground station within 2km due to limitations of the telemetry radio.

\subsection{Software System Attributes}
As this is a research project, requirements found along the way will be appended onto this section. 
%There are a number of attributes of software that can serve as requirements. It
%is important that required attributes be specified so that their achievement can
%be objectively verified. Subclauses 3.6.1 through 3.6.5 provide a partial list
%of examples.
%We will likely need to come up with more/different attributes

\subsection{Other Requirements}
%Define any other requirements not covered elsewhere in the SRS. This might 
%include database requirements, internationalization requirements, legal 
%requirements, reuse objectives for the project, and so on. Add any new sections 
%that are pertinent to the project.
As this is a research project, requirements found along the way will be appended onto this section.

%\subsection{Appendix A: Glossary}
%see https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Glossary
% Define all the terms necessary to properly interpret the SRS, including 
% acronyms and abbreviations. You may wish to build a separate glossary that spans 
% multiple projects or the entire organization, and just include terms specific to 
% a single project in each SRS.

%\subsection{Appendix B: Analysis Models}
% Optionally, include any pertinent analysis models, such as data flow 
% diagrams, class diagrams, state-transition diagrams, or entity-relationship 
% diagrams.

%\subsection{Appendix C: To Be Determined List}
%Collect a numbered list of the TBD (to be determined) references that remain 
%in the SRS so they can be tracked to closure.
