\section{Introduction} % Section 1; Cierra, Done
This document aims to provide an overview and list of requirements for group 44, Autonomous RC (ARC). 
This section provides a purpose and scope description, list of abbreviations and acronyms, and an overview of everything included in this SRS document. 
As this is a research project, some of the sections within the document may not apply to the project. 


\subsection{Purpose} % Cierra, Done
A detailed description of the requirements for the "Autonomous RC System" or ARCS will be provided within this document. 
System constraints, interface decisions, and interactions with other external applications and hardware will also be explained. 
This document is primarily intended to be a customer proposal for approval and a development team reference for the first version of the system.

\subsection{Scope} % Cierra, Done
ARCS is a software-hardware interface designed to retrofit RC cars for autonomous operation, using commodity hardware. 
The software and hardware specifications should be available free to download and modify at the users will. \par
Users should be able to purchase and install the specified hardware from major online retailes such as Amazon.com or hobby sites such as Sparkfun.com.
Once the vehicle is assembled, it should be able to autonomously navigate to a given destination using GPS, or a within pre-defined boundaries, such as a room.  
Control software will need to be loaded onto the main processing unit and any other control hardware needed. 
Other software required will be a control panel to monitor the vehicle and determine it's behavior, such as navigating to a point, or on a track. 

Hardware that we expect to need:
\begin{itemize} 
\item Base station that includes a transceiver
\item An RC car with servo steering and DC motors
\item Main processing unit (a computer)
\item Transceiver to send and receive information on the car
\item Controller to send signals to sensors and actuation devices (motors, servos, etc...) 
\item Vision system to aide in obstacle avoidance
\item GPS unit to aide in navigation
\end{itemize}

ARCS will be expected to be able to receive input from a user base station, and react
within the environment based on a destination or path that the system receives. It should also
be able to navigate to the destination without user intervention, as fast as possible. \par

\subsection{Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations} % Tao, in progress
%This subsection should provide the definitions of all terms, acronyms, and
%abbreviations required to properly interpret the SRS. This information may be
%provided by reference to one or more appendixes in the SRS or by reference to
%other documents.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{IMUs:} Inertial measurement unit. Used to measure acceleration, angular acceleration, and orientation of the vehicle.
	\item \textbf{Operator/User:} The person who is giving commands such as destination to the system.
	\item \textbf{Protocol:} Defines the data format to be transferred.
	\item \textbf{Telemetry Data:} Data that contains the status information of the vehicle, such as speed, temperature, location, battery, etc.
	\item \textbf{Emergency:} Emergencies include, but are not limited to: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The vehicle drifts off course significantly.
		\item Vehicle flips upside down.
		\item On-board components fall off.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Visual Unit:} Visual components that provide image streams to the main processing unit. 
	The primary computer will extract information from the images, such as road condition, obstacles, and depth. 
	\item \textbf{Actuators:} Motors and servos.
	\item \textbf{Initialization:} From the system perspective, the initialization process will include self-checking and sensor calibration. 
	From the user's perspective, it contains making sure all the hardware is attached, battery is at least 80\% full, and giving the system a destination. 
	\item \textbf{Success:} The vehicle successfully navigates itself to the destination.
	\item \textbf{ARC:} Autonomous Remote Controlled is our team name
	\item \textbf{ARCS:} ARC System, which refers to both hardware and software components built for the project.
	\item \textbf{RC:} Remote Controled
	\item \textbf{AV:} Autonomous Vehicle
	\item \textbf{Main Processing Unit:} The unit which handles all high level decisions and input processing. 
	\item \textbf{Stakeholder:} Any user that will operate ARCS.

\section{Overall Description} % Section 2; Cierra, Done
This section will explain the system in its context to create a better understanding of how the system interacts with other systems.
In addition, basic functionality will be introduced and addressed. 
Stakeholders will be defined and functionality for each type of stakeholder will be adressed. 
Lastly, constraints and assumptions for the system will be presented. 

% This section usually consists of six subsections, as follows:
% \begin{enumerate}
%	\item Product perspective;
%	\item Product functions;
%	\item User characteristics;
%	\item Constraints;
%	\item Assumptions and dependencies;
%	\item Apportioning of requirements.
% \end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Product Perspective} % Cierra, kinda done for now
ARCS will be designed to integrate into an RC car using commodity hardware, and open to anyone who is interested in using it. This 
makes ARCS a component of a larger system, namely the RC car. \par
ARCS will consist of three parts: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Base-station used for user interaction
	\item Hardware attached to RC car to be able to connect to base-station and 
		operate the vehicle
	\item Software implementation for control and communication between hardware and software
\end{enumerate}
In order for the user to interact with the vehicle, commands will be sent via some form
of receiver to the car. This will need to be done via a base-station that has software able of
providing a way to communicate with the receiver, which then transmits data to the receiver on 
the car, which is then handled by the on-board computer. 
The control flow is described in figure 1. \\

%%% THIS IS FOR DRAWING THE BLOCK DIAGRAM %%%git

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% This subsection of the SRS should put the product into perspective with other
% related products. If the product is independent and totally self-contained, it
% should be so stated here. If the SRS defines a product that is a component of a
% larger system, as frequently occurs, then this subsection should relate the
% requirements of that larger system to functionality of the software and should
% identify interfaces between that system and the software.

%A block diagram showing the major components of the larger system,
%interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful.
%
%This subsection should also describe how the software operates inside various
%constraints. For example, these constraints could include
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item System interfaces;
%	\item User interfaces;
%	\item Hardware interfaces;
%	\item Software interfaces;
%	\item Communications interfaces;
%	\item Memory;
%	\item Operations;
%	\item Site adaptation requirements.
%\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{System interfaces} %Tao, finished
There are a total of 5 system interfaces where the system can communicate with 
the outside world.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Sensors: Sensors will have a two-way communication with a secondary computer unit, where filtering and smoothing will happen before reliable data will be passed to the main processing unit. 
	The programs that reside in the secondary unit will utilize various methods to generate reliable results based on the raw data. 
	At start-up, there will be a script executed by the system to correctly configure and calibrate each sensor. 
	Sensors may include: battery monitor, temperature sensor, GPS, encoders, IMUs, and any other sensors that are needed for autonomous operation.
	\item Radio: This is the portal of the system where operator/user can monitor the status of the vehicle. 
	Different protocols will be implemented for telemetry data, which will be displayed to the operator/user. 
	This portal also allows operator/user to take control over the computer in case of emergencies. 
	\item Visual unit: This is the interface where the visual unit can pass streams of images to the system.
	\item Actuator: The system issues commands to the motors and servos via this interface. 
	\item User interface: This interface is a different interface than the radio interface even though they both allow humans to interact with the system. 
	The user interface will be disable after the vehicle starts maneuvering. 
	This interface allows user to input operation modes and desired destinations into the system.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{User interfaces} %Tao, finished
The user interface will be a graphical user interface (GUI) that can be interacted with by a user. 
Anyone who knows how to operate a mouse or touch screen will be al. 
A map makes it easier for users to pin point destinations and view the current location of the vehicle. 
An error messages will be generated the vehicle and the station exceeds the maximum radio range, or the vehicle is low on battery.\par
With proper training (in less than 30 minutes), one can understand all the indicators of the system to know the status of the vehicle.\par
The GUI is a single window/page arrangement. 
A large portion of the window is dedicated to the map. 
A section of the GUI will be used to display telemetry data. 
Error messages will cover at least 10\% of the screen in order to alert the user of an issue.

\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces} % Cierra
Two main hardware interfaces currently exist within ARCS. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Vision processing
	\item Telemetry collection and actuator control
\end{enumerate}

Vision 
Vision processing, from either a stereoscopic or depth camera, will be interfaced through 
an i5 or better processor from an on board computer using a control board, specifically 
the PXSF on top of a Raspberry Pi or UP board, will be used as an interface between a 
computer that is doing high level computations, and the servos, motors, and other telemetry 
devices. 
And they should be able to do these things....

%This should specify the logical characteristics of each interface between the
%software product and the hardware components of the system. This includes
%configuration characteristics (number of ports, instruction sets, etc.). It also
%covers such matters as what devices are to be supported, how they are to be
%supported, and protocols. For example, terminal support may specify full-screen
%support as opposed to line-by-line support.


\subsubsection{Software Interfaces} % Dan
%This should specify the use of other required software products (e.g., a data
%management system, an operating system, or a mathematical package), and
%interfaces with other application systems (e.g., the linkage between an accounts
%receivable system and a general ledger system). For each required software
%product, the following should be provided:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Name;
%	\item Mnemonic;
%	\item Specification number;
%	\item Version number;
%	\item Source.
%\end{itemize}
%
%
%For each interface, the following should be provided:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Discussion of the purpose of the interfacing software as related to
%		this software product.
%	\item Definition of the interface in terms of message content and format. It
%		is not necessary to detail any well-documented interface, but a
%		reference to the document defining the interface is required.
%\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
	
	\item We require three operating systems. One for a remote PC for user input, one
	for the primary computer for on-car data analysis, and one for the secondary
	computer for on-car control.
	
	\item We require a user interface to be able to give the car destination commands. 
	
	\item We require software that takes input from hardware, such as video cameras,
	and analyze the data 
	
	\item Sensor analysis software needs to be able to read data from sensors, such IMUs, and generate usable information to pass on to 
	
	\item Path finding software needs to be able to integrate and analyze data from mapping and localization software products and determine a path to follow in real time.
	
	\item The primary and secondary computers will need to talk with one another. The
	primary computer will need to receive data from the secondary computer,
	analyze the data and send corresponding commands back to the secondary
	computer. The secondary computer will need to receive commands from the
	primary computer, and send data to the primary computer.
	
	\item A software interface will required on the secondary computer to convert
	commands received from the primary computer to instructions usable by
	pre-existing RC car on-board controller.
	
	\item We will require separate interfaces between the secondary computer and the
	visual/spacial sensors, GPS, speed sensor, and the IMU. 
	
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Communications Interfaces} % Dan
%This should specify the various interfaces to communications such as local
%network protocols, etc.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Radio communication will required to be able to send commands to the car and
	to be able to receive feedback from the car. The radio frequency will be in 27
	MHz or 49 MHz range. We need software that allows us to send and receive radio
	signals to and from the car. 
	
	\item LAN communication will be used to transmit data between the on-car computers.
	Existing network protocols will be utilized to perform the transmissions.
	
	\item A software interface will be required to send the commands from the
	secondary computer to the pre-existing RC car on-board controller.
	
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Memory constraints} %Tao, done
%This should specify any applicable characteristics and limits on primary and
%secondary memory.
Since we are unsure of what hardware will be used, we are not able to set any 
constraints on the memory requirements that the system has to meet. 

\subsubsection{Operations} %Tao
In most cases, operations of the system will be isolated from the user/operator,
excluding emergencies and initialization.  
%This should specify the normal and special operations required by the user such as
\begin{enumerate}
	\item At initailization, user/operator has to thoroughly check the body of the
	vehicle, making usre that all components are firmly attached as well as the 
	bettary level is at least 80\%;
	\item Destination will be given by the user at the station during initialization;
	\item User is allowed to take over control from the system in case of emergencies
	via the remote control;
	\item User/operator is resposible for monitoring the status of the system, such as 
	battery level, speed, location, distance, radio signal strength, pre-planned path, 
	etc.
\end{enumerate}
%This could the extension of the user interface section.
%This is sometimes specified as part of the User Interfaces section.

\subsubsection{Site Adaptation Requirements}
For research and prototype purposes, no site adaptation requirements are relevant. 

\subsection{Product Functions} %Tao, finished
This system utilizes resources from more than one computer and controls multiple actuators. 
The system is designed to minimize user interference during operations, however, monitoring is required.
Maintainability of the system is not considered to be user-oriented, which means a user/operator should not be worried about maintaining the system. 
The system will be made available publicly (open source), however, only users with extensive robotics experience should attempt at modifying the system outside of the given parameters.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%This subsection of the SRS should provide a summary of the major functions that
%the software will perform. For example, an SRS for an accounting program may use
%this part to address customer account maintenance, customer statement, and
%invoice preparation without mentioning the vast amount of detail that each of
%those functions requires.\par
%
%Sometimes the function summary that is necessary for this part can be taken
%directly from the section of the higher-level specification (if one exists) that
%allocates particular functions to the software product. Note that for the sake
%of clarity
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item The functions should be organized in a way that makes the list of
%		functions understandable to the customer or to anyone else reading the
%		document for the first time.
%	\item Textual or graphical methods can be used to show the different
%		functions and their relationships. Such a diagram is not intended to
%		show a design of a product, but simply shows the logical relationships
%		among variables.
%\end{enumerate}

\subsection{User Characteristics} % Cierra
Our system should be able to be built and operated by a user with at least two 
years of university engineering coursework and one two years, a user with over 
five years of technical experience through work in either an electrical or software 
industry, and a RC hobbyist with over five years of experience. 

\subsection{Constraints} % Tao, finished
As this is a research project, constraints may rapidly change or new constraints may be retroactively added to better address problems found or the needs of the system. \par
Current constraints for the project include: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Real time image processing will limit the vehicle's ability to maneuver through obstacles. 
	\item Telemetry data displayed to the user will be slightly delayed due to long distance. 
	No solutions to this issue are currently available.
	\item The vehicle's natural structure will inevitably cause more uncertainty on predictions, which requires the use of more complicated algorithms versus what is required for ideal conditions.
	\item Hardware may fall off during operation which will force the system to halt. 
	All components must be securely fastened and adequately protected in the case of an emergency.  
	\item Telemetry data transfer are limited to radio during outdoor operations.
	\item The success rate are set to 80\% and above.
	\item For research purpose only, the vehicle will only be required to navigate around static objects in an environment. 
	This is to reduce the complexity of the initial system. 
\end{enumerate}
%This subsection of the SRS should provide a general description of any other
%items that will limit the developer's options. These include
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item Regulatory policies;
%	\item Hardware limitations (e.g., signal timing requirements);
%	\item Interfaces to other applications;
%	\item Parallel operation;
%	\item Audit functions;
%	\item Control functions;
%	\item Higher-order language requirements;
%	\item Signal handshake protocols (e.g., XON-XOFF, ACK-NACK);
%	\item Reliability requirements;
%	\item Criticality of the application;
%	\item Safety and security considerations.
%\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Assumptions and Dependencies}
%This subsection of the SRS should list each of the factors that affect the
%requirements stated in the SRS. These factors are not design constraints on the
%software but are, rather, any changes to them that can affect the requirements
%in the SRS. For example, an assumption may be that a specific operating system
%will be available on the hardware designated for the software product. If, in
%fact, the operating system is not available, the SRS would then have to change
%accordingly.

\subsection{Apportionment of Requirements} % Dan, in progress
%This subsection of the SRS should identify requirements that may be delayed
%until future versions of the system.

\include{gantt_chart}

\section{Specific Requirements} % Section 3
%This section of the SRS should contain all of the software requirements to a
%level of detail sufficient to enable designers to design a system to satisfy
%those requirements, and testers to test that the system satisfies those
%requirements. Throughout this section, every stated requirement should be
%externally perceivable by users, operators, or other external systems. These
%requirements should include at a minimum a description of every input (stimulus)
%into the system, every output (response) from the system, and all functions
%performed by the system in response to an input or in support of an output. As
%this is often the largest and most important part of the SRS, the following
%principles apply:
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item Specific requirements should be stated in conformance with all the
%		characteristics described in 4.3.
%	\item Specific requirements should be cross-referenced to earlier documents
%		that relate.
%	\item All requirements should be uniquely identifiable.
%	\item Careful attention should be given to organizing the requirements to
%		maximize readability.
%\end{enumerate}
%
%Before examining specific ways of organizing the requirements it is helpful to
%understand the various items that comprise requirements as described in 3.1
%through 3.7.

\subsection{External interface requirements}
	\subsubsection{User interfaces}
	\subsubsection{Hardware interfaces}
	\subsubsection{Software interfaces}
	\subsubsection{Communications interfaces}

\subsection{System features}

\subsubsection{System Feature 1}

\paragraph{Introduction/Purpose of feature}~\\
This is a test of the introduction on a new line.

\paragraph{Stimulus/Response Sequence} 

	\begin{itemize}
		\item[]{3.2.1.3.1 Functional requirement 1}~\\
		%It should include both content and format as follows:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Name of item;
			\item Description of purpose;
			\item Source of input or destination of output;
			\item Valid range, accuracy, and/or tolerance;
			\item Units of measure;
			\item Timing;
			\item Relationships to other inputs/outputs;
			\item Screen formats/organization;
			\item Window formats/organization;
			\item Data formats;
			\item Command formats;
			\item End messages.
		\end{enumerate}
			.\\
			.\\
			.\\
		\item[]{3.2.1.3.n Functional requirement n}~\\
	\end{itemize}


\subsection{Performance Requirements}
%This subsection should specify both the static and the dynamic numerical
%requirements placed on the software or on human interaction with the software as
%a whole. Static numerical requirements may include the following:
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%	\item The number of terminals to be supported;
%	\item The number of simultaneous users to be supported;
%	\item Amount and type of information to be handled.
%\end{enumerate}
%
%Static numerical requirements are sometimes identified under a separate section
%entitled Capacity.
%
%Dynamic numerical requirements may include, for example, the numbers of
%transactions and tasks and the amount of data to be processed within certain
%time periods for both normal and peak workload conditions.
%
%All of these requirements should be stated in measurable terms.
%
%For example,
%
%\textit{95\% of the transactions shall be processed in less than 1 s.}
%
%rather than,
%
%\textit{An operator shall not have to wait for the transaction to complete.}
%
%Numerical limits applied to one specific function are normally specified as part
%of the processing subparagraph description of that function.

\subsection{Design constraints}
%This should specify design constraints that can be imposed by other standards,
%hardware limitations, etc.

\subsection{Software System Attributes}
%There are a number of attributes of software that can serve as requirements. It
%is important that required attributes be specified so that their achievement can
%be objectively verified. Subclauses 3.6.1 through 3.6.5 provide a partial list
%of examples.
%We will likely need to come up with more/different attributes

\subsection{Other Requirements}
%Define any other requirements not covered elsewhere in the SRS. This might 
%include database requirements, internationalization requirements, legal 
%requirements, reuse objectives for the project, and so on. Add any new sections 
%that are pertinent to the project.

\section{Index}

\section{Appendix}

\subsection{Appendix A: Glossary}
%see https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Glossary
% Define all the terms necessary to properly interpret the SRS, including 
% acronyms and abbreviations. You may wish to build a separate glossary that spans 
% multiple projects or the entire organization, and just include terms specific to 
% a single project in each SRS.

\subsection{Appendix B: Analysis Models}
% Optionally, include any pertinent analysis models, such as data flow 
% diagrams, class diagrams, state-transition diagrams, or entity-relationship 
% diagrams.

\subsection{Appendix C: To Be Determined List}
%Collect a numbered list of the TBD (to be determined) references that remain 
%in the SRS so they can be tracked to closure.
